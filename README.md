Finding out the past data using RNN. The method is just like the the time series forecasting. The only difference is that, we train the model of the present data and predict the past output. Here, the training and the testing data is is seperated using a window method. 
Some part of the data is isolated from the training set and the trained model is tested and compared with the isolated data.
